# Duh Editor

This is my code editor project.I just started this project and I will be commiting everything to github.

# Contributing
- Make a pull request and I will commit it if necessary.
- If you have good ideas open an issue and tell me about your idea.

# Requirements 
- wxWidgets 
- Change C/C++ and linker settings as your wxWidgets path.

# Testing
- Download the executable from [releases]
- If you are going to build it yourself please check requirements.

# TO-DO (main things)
- Syntax Highlighting
- Settings
- Better UI
- Open files side menu

# Reminder
- Releases are not sync with commits so building the project for testing is a better way.
